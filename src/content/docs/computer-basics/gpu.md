## What is a GPU?

A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is the part of your computer that handles **graphics**, **visuals**, and **heavy parallel tasks**.  

It draws everything you see on your screen — from animations to photos to 3D games. If you play games, edit videos, or use AI tools, the GPU matters a lot.

## What Does a GPU Actually Do?

- Renders 2D and 3D graphics  
- Runs games smoothly  
- Speeds up video editing, rendering, and animation  
- Accelerates AI, machine learning, and large computations  
- Helps with high-resolution displays (4K, 144 Hz, etc.)

Even everyday apps (Chrome, YouTube, Windows animations) use the GPU.

## GPU Types

![Integrated vs Dedicated GPU](/assets/images/integrated-vs-dedicated-gpu.png)

### 1. Integrated Graphics

Built into the CPU (like Intel UHD, AMD Vega, Apple M-series GPU).

Good for:
- Browsing  
- Watching videos  
- Light gaming  
- Basic editing  

Not great for:
- AAA gaming  
- Heavy 3D work  
- AI workloads  

### 2. Dedicated (Discrete) Graphics

Separate chip/card (like NVIDIA RTX or AMD Radeon).

Good for:
- Gaming  
- 3D modeling  
- Video editing  
- AI, ML workloads  
- Multi-monitor setups

### NVIDIA

- Known for strong performance  
- Best for AI, machine learning, productivity  
- RTX cards support ray tracing and DLSS  
- Very optimized drivers and software support  

### AMD Radeon

- Great performance for the price  
- Strong in gaming  
- Uses FSR (their version of upscaling)  
- Often better value at mid-range

### Apple (M-Series GPU)

- Integrated into the Apple Silicon chip  
- Very efficient  
- Great for video editing, everyday tasks  
- Not meant for high-end PC gaming

## GPU Naming Explained

### NVIDIA Naming

![RTX 3060 Ti](/assets/images/rtx-gpu-naming.png)

Example: `RTX 3060 Ti`

Breakdown:

- **RTX** → Supports ray tracing (GTX = older models)  
- **30** → Generation (20-series → older, 40-series → newer)  
- **60** → Tier (50 = entry, 60 = mid, 70 = high, 80 = enthusiast, 90 = top-end)  
- **Ti** → Slightly stronger version of the base model  
- **SUPER** → Mid-step between base and Ti

### AMD Radeon Naming

![Radeon RX 6700 XT](/assets/images/rx-gpu-naming.png)

Example: `Radeon RX 6700 XT`

Breakdown:

- **RX** → Radeon gaming series  
- **6** → Generation  
- **700** → Model (higher = stronger)  
- **XT** → More powerful version  
- **XTX** → Even stronger

### Apple GPUs

Simple:

- **M3 → Basic**
- **M3 Pro → Better**
- **M3 Max → High-end**
- **M3 Ultra → Extreme**

Same idea for M4 and M5 generations.

## How to Compare GPUs

Instead of guessing from the names, use these benchmark sites:

- **https://www.videocardbenchmark.net** → Simple charts  
- **https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/** → Detailed specs  
- **https://nanoreview.net/en/gpu-compare** → Amazing visual comparisons  

Look at:

- FPS in real games  
- VRAM  
- Power usage  
- Ray tracing performance  
- AI features (DLSS, FSR, etc.)

### Quick comparison rules:

- **Higher generation = better**  
- **More VRAM = better for editing / 4K gaming**  
- **Higher TDP = usually stronger (desktop)**  
- **Laptop GPUs are weaker than desktop versions**

## Where to Check Your GPU in Windows

![GPU in settings](/assets/images/gpu-in-settings.png)

### Method 1: Settings

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **System → Display**
3. Scroll down to **Advanced Display**
4. Look for **Display Adapter Properties**

### Method 2: Task Manager

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc**
2. Go to **Performance → GPU**

It shows GPU model, VRAM, usage and GPU temperature.

## VRAM (Video Memory) Explained

VRAM is memory just for the GPU.

- **4 GB** → Light gaming, 1080p  
- **6 GB** → OK for mid-range  
- **8–12 GB** → Comfortable for modern games and editing  
- **16 GB+** → High-end, 4K, AI workloads  

More VRAM helps when working with big textures, large videos, 4K monitors, or AI models.

## Final Notes

You don’t need to understand every technical detail to pick a good GPU.  
Just remember:

- Choose based on what you actually need  
- Use benchmark sites when comparing  
- Integrated GPUs are fine for everyday use  
- Dedicated GPUs shine in games, editing, and AI  
- And don’t get fooled by flashy numbers — generation and benchmarks matter most
