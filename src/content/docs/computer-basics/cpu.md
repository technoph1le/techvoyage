## What is a CPU?

The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is basically your computer’s **brain**.

It handles instructions, does calculations, and keeps everything running smoothly — from opening apps to playing games.

If your computer feels slow, the CPU is one of the first things worth checking.

## Popular CPU Brands

There are **3** main players you’ll see most of the time:

![Intel, AMD and M chip](/assets/images/intel-amd-mchip.png)

### Intel
- Known for great performance and stability  
- Popular in laptops and desktops  
- Usually better for battery efficiency on Windows laptops

### AMD Ryzen
- Strong multi-core performance  
- Great for gaming, editing, and multitasking  
- Often cheaper for the performance you get

### Apple M-Series (M1, M2, M3…)
- Found only in MacBooks and iMacs  
- Extremely efficient and fast  
- Uses a totally different architecture (ARM), meaning macOS is optimized for it

## Intel CPU Naming

Intel models look confusing at first, but they follow a pattern. 

Here’s the quick way to understand them:

![Intel CPU example](/assets/images/intel-naming.png)

Example: `Intel Core i5-12400F`

Breakdown:

- **i5** → The tier (i3 = basic, i5 = mid, i7 = high-end, i9 = top-end)  
- **12** → 12th generation (higher = newer)  
- **400** → Model number (higher = better within the same generation)  
- **F** → No integrated graphics (needs a GPU)

### Other common letters:

- **K** — Overclockable (faster if you tune it)  
- **F** — No built-in graphics  
- **H** — High performance (laptops)  
- **U** — Ultra-efficient (thin laptops)  
- **P** — Mid-performance laptop chips

## Intel vs Ryzen vs Apple – Quick Differences

| Feature | Intel | AMD Ryzen | Apple M-Chips |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Best for | Balanced use | Multitasking, gaming | Battery, creative work |
| Laptops | Efficient and smooth | Often stronger for price | Excellent battery & performance |
| Desktops | Great single-core | Great multi-core | Not available |

If you want:
- **Gaming:** Ryzen or Intel (new generations)  
- **Video editing:** Ryzen or Apple M-series  
- **Everyday use / school:** Any of them work fine

## Comparing CPUs

Instead of looking at long specs, use these CPU benchmark sites

- **https://cpu.userbenchmark.com** → Quick and simple  
- **https://www.cpubenchmark.net** → More technical but accurate  
- **https://nanoreview.net** → Best side-by-side visuals

Search for CPUs, and you’ll see:

- Overall performance score  
- Gaming score  
- Single-core vs multi-core  
- Power usage  
- Value for money

### How to decide which is better:

- **Higher generation** = usually better  
- **Higher single-core score** = faster apps, better gaming  
- **Higher multi-core score** = better for editing, rendering  
- **Lower wattage** = better battery life

## Where to Check Your CPU in Windows

You can find your CPU info in a few seconds:

![Checking CPU info in settings](/assets/images/cpu-in-settings.png)

### Method 1: Settings

1. Open **Settings** in Windows 11
2. Go to **System** → **About**
3. Look for **Processor**

### Method 2: Task Manager

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc**  
2. Go to the **Performance** tab  
3. Click **CPU**

You’ll see:
- Model name  
- Current speed  
- Number of cores and threads  
- Usage graph

## Extra Things Worth Knowing

### Cores & Threads

- **More cores** = better for multitasking  
- **More threads** = smoother performance  
Most modern CPUs have 4–16 cores.

### Clock Speed

- Measured in GHz.  
- Higher = faster… *but only within the same generation.*
- A 4.5 GHz old CPU can be slower than a 3.5 GHz new one.

### Integrated Graphics

- Some CPUs (like Intel’s non-F models) have built-in graphics.  
- This is helpful if you don’t have a dedicated GPU.

I'll cover more about Integrated Graphics in the [GPU guide](/computer-basics/gpu).

## Final Notes

You don’t need to be a tech expert to understand CPUs.

Just remember:
- Check the **generation**  
- Compare on **benchmark websites**  
- Pick based on what you'll actually use it for  
- And don’t stress — most modern CPUs are already way faster than the average user needs
