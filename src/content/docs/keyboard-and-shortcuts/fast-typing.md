Typing without looking at your keyboard is cool, but typing with **all 10 fingers** is a whole different level. It takes time, but with the right tools, you can progress faster.

These are the 3 sites I used personally to go from ~20 WPM to **90–100 WPM** in a few months. Each one trains a different part of your typing skill.
