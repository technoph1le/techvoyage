Hey, there. 👋 Thanks for checking out!

Being comfortable and confident with computers is a real advantage today - in work, school, business, and everyday life. That's why I created this guide: to help anyone who wants to get into tech or build a strong foundation in IT, starting from the very basics.

You can treat this as your learning path, your reference, or your "go-to" place whenever you get stuck or want to grow further.

## Who this is for

* Beginners who want to understand tech step by step
* Students who want a structured and clear path
* Curious learners who like building things, not just reading about them

No experience needed.

## What you'll learn

By the end, you'll understand:

* How computers and the internet actually work
* How to use tools and services like a modern digital creator
* How to organize, communicate, and collaborate online
* Basics of programming and how websites are built
* How to turn your skills into real projects

## How to use this guide

* Follow the sidebar in order — it's designed to layer concepts naturally
* Try every task, mini project, or challenge (they matter!)
* Don't speed-run; understanding > memorizing
* Ask questions and take notes in your own words
* Come back to sections anytime — learning is not linear

## A quick reminder

Even if you're good at IT, you might come across some cool concepts along the way.
