I'm Technophile - a full-stack developer and content creator on YouTube. Mentoring students and teaching concepts have been a main part of my job for a long time.

I started this guide because I noticed something: most people use computers every day, but very few really understand them or feel confident exploring beyond the basics. My goal is to help change that - step by step - in a friendly and practical way.

## YouTube

I create coding & tech content on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@technophile).
