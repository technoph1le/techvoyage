## Hello there

You'll need to have a Node.js version installed, and preferably something after v20.16. I wrote this course with 20.16 but it should be fairly future-proof.

> This is also an example.

I use fnm to manage my Node.js versions (similar to nvm).

<Info>This is also an example.</Info>

I think this course would work with recent versions of bun or deno but it's untested. Beware if you decide go down this path.
