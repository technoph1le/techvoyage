## Hello there

You'll need to have a Node.js version installed, and preferably something after v20.16. I wrote this course with 20.16 but it should be fairly future-proof.

I use fnm to manage my Node.js versions (similar to nvm).

I think this course would work with recent versions of bun or deno but it's untested. Beware if you decide go down this path.

This is also a paragraph.
